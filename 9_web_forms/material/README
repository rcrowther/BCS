Two web forms for practice and illustration of points to do with completion of web forms. The two forms have been redirected so they do nothing online (some of the links will work, though).

The form used (the 'Submit' form is a modification) is not original, it is from an existing site. As such, it has pretty presentation and is plainly part of a wider configurable system. It demonstrates several features of form filling, lacking only radio selectiors. Sadly, the Javascript checks have become disabled somewhere, and I don't have time to sort those out.

The ''Submit' button leads to the enclosed ''Submit' page, so can be used safely.

Incidentally, the form illustrates several acessibility failures. A tutor, or more advanced students, can amuse themselves with these.
