= Short Course
Note for teachers: the course should be completed on computers with two separate operating sysems. We do not mention this in the short course, but the information in each module can be completed on any operating systems. We currently use Win10 and KUbuntu. An Apple comuter has a few different strokes, notably it's single click paradigm, but that will not hinder a tutor who is able to use an Apple system. A cross-system, even mobile system, approach is encouraaged. 
 
= Short course
== 1. Using a computer

=== Equipment

=== Verification
Can you move files and launch a program from a file?


== 3 Internet
=== Equipment
Computers with internet connection
A router

=== Information
Everyone talks about the ''web', ''webpages', and ''going online'. Connecting to others through agreed ways is modern life.
 
How does it work? Servers
Can be connected using wire or Wifi
Different browsers (Firefox remembers what you were doing ''Restore last Session'). Back buttons, tabs. downloading. 
What is it for?  Get information

=== Exercise
Visit sone websites,

- Wikipedia
- Youtube
- https://www.etymonline.com/
- Google Maps
- Ebay
- Gutenberg
- gov.uk 
: https://www.gov.uk/

Notice how the address changes

==== When it goes wrong
Broken connections are common, especailly with Wifi. Try turning the computer off and on. And the router. Check passwords are right. Uusually it will restart within an hour. If not, a computer person can fix it. Ring the internet provider.
 
==== Safety
Don't download anything you don't trust
Don't reply to phonecalls, and never give out your details (don't send anything).
The web can be seen by anyone, wherever you go. So be polite. Even to friends on Twitter or Facebook.  

=== Additional

Sometimes a search returns inappropriate material. You can switch on ''safesearch', bu the easiest thing to do is recognise what you have typed is is not what you intetended, and try again.

==== Safety
If webpages appear strange, will not load, or ask for details, go backwards (sometimes is blocked) or close the tab.

If you have not sent anything, or downloaded anything, you are ok.

Sometimes naughty, violent, or things you do not agree with, will appear. You must accept that the world is very big.

=== Exercise

== 5. Program UI
=== Equipment
Computers with a GUI Desktop.
Use a text editor like Kate. This contains most ideas demonstrated.

=== Information
Most programs to do things have the same tools and ways to run them.

Using menus, how menus work an operating system also,

- File (Save, Save As, Print, Preferences, Exit/Quit)
- Edit (Cut Paste)
- View
- Search (Find/Replace)
- Help

Many ways to do same things:
- The buttons do the same thing, but faster. 
- Right-click menu
- Keyboard strokes 
Many ways to do things, same place. Use 'print' as an example.

Using scrollbars, sizing, arrows, the gutter, the wheel and arrow keys.


=== When it goes wrong
Look in the menus, then use the internet (do not use Help)

==== Safety
Nothing is for 'free'. If people offer a free program, check if they use the program. Often these programs have adverts and can steal from or break your computer. Some programs are given to the community. Sometimes these are good, sometimes they are hard to use and have no information.

Don't put too many programs on your phone or computer. They will slow it down.

=== Exercise
Look in a text editor for the many ways to 'print' and 'save'.

Use the main menus to find programs, and guess or ask what they do (at this point, we have not used the internet, but you can still try).

- Calculator
- Text Editor (not a word processor. e.g. Leaf/Gedit)
- Character Map
- Audio/Video player (e.g. Windows Media Palyer/VLC)
- Desktop preferences
- File browser
- System Monitor

copyright

=== When it goes wrong
Logons go wrong. Websites remember your details. You must put a new password in. A verification code will be sent to your email account. You type that back in to make it work. Read the steps. Wait for the email. Impatience will be your enemy. 



=== Exercise
Try some of these things

=== Additional
Live IRC client

If you're worried, use the phone, not the internet.
Beware english that is not official-sounding
Do not click or download anything
Look and spellcheck before you send

=== Exercise

== 8. Word processing
=== Equipment
Examples: e.g. poster, booklet (for cover and contents), mindmap vs. CV, reports, letter
Computers with word processors

Things that are not word processing
Quick mention of templates---mostly unused

==== Safety
Ignore appeal letters
A letter is not in the same language as you would speak. Beware of not being formal.

=== Exercise
(example) Which one of these can be done in a word-processor?
Work through the formatting as a guided exercise. To make it more fun, students can choose an end target document style of their choice.

=== Additional Information
Printing
- Print previews
- Portrait/landscape
- Use page and page range, not 'all'
- Note on 'letter' vs. 'A4' jambing printers (also on PDFs)
- If a page will not print, will another print? Pages are frequently set up wrong.
- When a printer goes wrong, it is bust. Find another, or call a technician, but don't waste time on it.

=== Additional Exercise
Try some mindmap software e.g. VYM---View Your Mind (Linux), or Blumind (Windows). Both basic, but effective for purpose. Or, for Â£40, Inspiration (Windows).

=== Verification
Mostly, did you reach the end of this tedious exercise? And know when not to use a word processor?


== 9. Internet forms
=== Equipment
A fake web form, or buttons, to play with???

=== Information
http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/0/22717885
Keep your information somewhere else, and cut and paste. Much easier!
Don't use the back button! It often will not work!
Sometimes multi-step forms have ''save' buttons. Try them first!
Form items:
- Fields
- Select
- Radio
???
- 'Submit'
You can change things until you press submit
The submit button can have many names
Country is difficult---do you know what names you use? (e.g. Great Britain, United Kingdom)

==== Safety
If you press submit on EBay or RyanAir it will cost you money. This is a legal agreement, you can not go back! However, UK Law now says, in many cases, you do have time to change or cancel your order.

=== Exercise
How to use the various buttons and selectors
About how it does nothing until submit (even if things change)

=== Additional
??? Submit a form for something fun???
