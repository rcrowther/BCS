Two samples, a Tex and a word processed (OpenOffice) PDF. These illustrate the differences between a word processor and a dedicated program. The Open Office document has been worked hard to look like the Tex. Also, the text used is plain, so the differences are subtle. The Tex has better use of fonts, punctuation, special characters, justification (word spacing), handling of fringe cases like erratic line ends, and so on.

These samples should be supplemented with other samples, such as leaflets, small posters, diagrams from books or for display, front covers of books etc. It's expected that most of this material would be immediately on hand in any learnng environment.

This will illustrate that word processors are not good at many things, and that dedicated programs are needed for such output. It might be worth raising the argument that word processors are not really that good at doing what they are supposed to do, which is lay out text for printing and reading.
