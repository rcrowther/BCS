The course is optional, and often collaborative and community-based.

Modules can be abandoned whenever a pupil or teacher wants to.

Modules can be taken in any order that the organiser can manage. If a module needs another module then this is noted in the plans. For example, the ''search' and ''files' modules need at least basic skills to use the keyboard, but they do not need the full ''touch-type' module to do them.
  
The course plans do not use the words ''teacher' and ''pupil'. Plans are mostly written from the point of view of the ''teacher', and say ''you' wen they mean the ''pupil'.

There is a short course and a long course. The short course is not the same as the long course, and in different order, but near enough. 

The long course is organised into modules. Each lesson in the short course is more or less the start, or a quick introduction, to a long course module. If you want to learn more about a subject, or think it would be helpful, you can move move from the short course introduction to do the long course modules.
