It is intended that much of this work, the main syllabus and support material, be released under Creative Commons licences. However, at the time of writing, the work is not completed or tested to anything like the extent I would prefer. The intention was to add Commons Licences as the work matured. For present, if a file contains the licence, then the work is under that licence. Otherwise, I retain copyright.

All source material, where plainly there is a source, is to the best of my knowledge (I have checked), under free licensing. 

The comment above applies to work where I use material for the basis of diagrams, text, or other course material. Within the syllabus and teaching material there may be references (not realized work), for example, to commercial websites. The referenced work may be under commercial licenses and/or have copyright held by other parties. Also, there may be complete items which are used for research, and that have not been converted for use in the course. These may also be under commercial licenses and/or have copyright held by other parties.
