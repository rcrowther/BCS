Good info, bad organisation. They put internet first.

Appears to have vanished, aside from the BBC training manual.

Do courses ...but don't publish. Many now use DigitalUnite.

=== DigitalUnite

Good material, badlty organised. Bias.

== Online courses
There are many. They inevitably start with ''hardware/software' i.e. are written by techicians with no idea of real-world needs and usage, and introduce material which would only be of use in any pracctical or philosophical way for technicians. While leaving out vital information. They are open, unlike the frequent closures of official exams, but sameas, they are heavily bias, this time towards towards a profession (male, ageist, and Western cultural), not a commercial fantasy.

== Quick note
It seems the British Government, arround 2009 was supporting computer literacy. This has vanished, sinking into some murk that ""People have all the help they need" and various charity initiatives. The fact is, people are not getting the help they need (??? facts?) and nobody but only a few charity initiatives are trying.
