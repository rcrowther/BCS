Not hard to better an IT syllabus, is it?

== Computer Science
A bit about flow diagrams, punch cards, not bad as intro.

== IT
IT from old theory about four kinds of software, databases, spreadsheets, word processors, presentation software. Also around commercial software, office suites. 

Two problems,
- Proven that nobody but a small selection of secretaries use computers like this
- Fast moving area, not self-actuated learning

== Against
++
- Examining boards
: Made inroads
- Raspberry PI movement
: Self-satisfied and class-prejudice, but have a point and represent a radically different outlook (Open Source).
+

== Current state
Not hard to better this, is it?

== Mis-steps
Not self-actuated
Learning base mismatched

=== Not self-actuated
Nobody uses help. they use friends and the internet.
Must teach general user UI
Must teach a little about operating systems and programs (not wha the words are)
Must teach configuration of operating system (and languages)
Must teach about text, and how it works on a computer
Must teach about search, it's a cross-application subject.

=== Learning base mismatched
==== Programs

==== Information
People go on a computer to:
- send messages to friends via twitter/Facebook/email
- buy clothes
- look for recipies
- play games
- (sometimes) because the government tells them to look for jobs
- Maps

Need:
Files
word processing
browsers
Web forms
video
PNG/JPEG, what is PDF
email
Search techniques
logons
Updates
backups
General interface help
General info on servers


Stuff we don't need,
Guides to lots of programs
Databases
Image software
Audio
Mobiles
Powerpoint
Spreadsheets

== Order of need
Most people need, in this order, or close,
Typing/mouse
Files
Programs (general UI)
Mail
Word processing
Internet forms
Internet search


== So this course...
- Stresses self-actuated learning
- Includes security and legaity within wide discussion about what computers are for and do  
- Covers more background, such as servers
- Ignores lots of conventional information, especially on individual programs
- Highlights the filesystem, interface design, and searching
