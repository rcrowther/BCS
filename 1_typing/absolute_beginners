= Absolute beginners
First lessons for absolute beginners, those who have never used a computer keyboard, or mouse.


== First---take the edge from the computer
I use a wooden bird. You can use many different things, a plant, a baseball, it can depend on your audience.

This is a prop, but it is an important prop. It establishes a bridge between the computer (a forbidding and complex device), and the student. It can also be used by a teacher---if there is a communication problem, it can be the ''bird of communication', who will sing while we learn, and who will listen when we do not understand each other.


== Start with the letters on the keyboard
This is not where other tutorials start. Other tutorials skim this, saying you must reach 20 WPM (this is ridiculous, when the majority of the population can not touch-type), or give an airy 'learn the keyboard and the mouse. You can find tutorials online...'. This is also feeble---it ignores Health & Safety about ergonomics, and fails to take ownership of a major learning hurdle.

Unlike the mouse, the keyboard can be lunged into, the results are comprehensible (what is a touchpad for?) and that for a forbidding item. Imagine how connected it feels to be able to use it---it is a transferrable skill, the purpose is comprehensible, and usage means a feeling of having cleared a major hurdle and grasped the computer. No other part of an introduction can do this.


== Keyboard
=== Equipment
The short syllabus states:

A computer
A laptop too, if possible

==== Additional Equipment for absolute beginners
~ A second keyboard for the teacher (can be dummy)
: This should be set up in parallel with at least some of the student keyboards. It does not need to be connected to a computer---it can be carried round.

~ A running text editor. 
: Not a word processor, a text editor---Workpad on Windows, Kate on K, Gedit on GNU etc. This should be launched by the teacher (absolute beginners, right?)

~ The humming keyboard???
: The purpose of this is to offer feedback, but not the dispiriting feedback of wrong letters, concentrating on the rythmn, visuals and sound.


== Information
=== Writing the name
If needed, launch the word processor. the teacher should do this. Then ask the students to type their name.

This is the first thing most people will do with a graphic or text editing package. It breaks the control barrier to a computer. It can give a teacher valuable information. You see the current typing ability. That helps with the next step.


=== Decide wether to go for learning touch-type or finger-poke
Let's be practical---many will have learned to finger-poke. You may as well leave them to it.

==== Finger-poke
Check the ergonomics. Check and re-enforce the learning via nmonics.

That's it.

==== Touch-type
===== Home keys
Point out the home keys with the bump. Indicate that this is where the index fingers go.

This is where the second keyboard becomes helpful, so you can simply demonstrate in parrallel. Also, you do not have to be flash or intimidating, pouring words onto the screen,

===== Memonic reference
Current nmonics are for British-Urdu speaking learners,

====== Left Index
R Rochdale
F Flower
V 
G Garden/Girl
R
====== Right Index
J Jam
K Kite


===== Tap and Up/Down Movements
Try repetition of the 'f' and ''j' keys. Then alternation of the keys.

Re-enforce the keys with nmonics. I'm currently using ''Food' and ''Jam'. The nmoics should be geared to the audience.

If you need more, show the hand movement upwards to ''Rochdale' and ''Urdu' (up is easier than down).

This is plenty for a first session, will take 20 mins to stop finger-poking. If you need to vary this, you can try down too, or breifly move to the next step. Ive also found it is worth leaving students to try alone, Indeed, some students have requested that they get to try alone for ten minutes or so. If they request, you really should let them go. Go make a coffee or something.


===== Walk Movements
This is is whole extra step in learning finger agility. It's worth practicing off the keyboard.

You need to practice walking the first two fingers of both handss. This is very like guitar playing. Indeed, it can be practiced without any keboard at all, which is worth mentioning (while waking or on the bus, for example). Finally, it will need to be extended to all fingers, so mention that too.

===== Practice and menonics for the middle fingers
Now practice walking the middle and index fingers. Make sure you nmonicize the keys--''D' and ''Karma'.


==== Re-enforce ergonomics
 Where and how to sit
- Sit in good position
- Stay away from screen
- Elbows in 
- Don't rest wrists
- Relax
- Tap keys, not hit them

About typing
- home keys have bumps
- The letters are in the wrong place deliberately
- Type at steady speed
- Try not to look at keyboard
- Try to look in front for words?
- You will get tired!

== The mouse
Since I only recommend attempting touch-typing start for 20-30mins, the remaining time can naturally be used on the mouse.

=== Equipment
A leaflet, or other small piece of hand-sized paper
 
== Information
=== Start with paper, or a leaflet---up/down/left/right
Do not start with the mouse. I've found it is too tempting to press the buttons. This is confusing---is the mouse moving with buttons, or the movement? Mouse movement is not intuitive.

Start by sliding paper round a table. Up/down/left/right. This also encourages a flat wrist and knuckles (i.e good ergonomics)

==== Transfer to the screen
Do not attempt to move off screen. Just stress up/down/left/right.

This is plenty for a first 20min session. The mouse movement is awkward.

==== Try targeting points
For single students, point to the screen (careful not to challenge with too big a movement). For a class, this is more difficult???

==== Try the ''lift and restore' move
The only way I have found of doing this is to dumb-show the move, and ask people to learn it. Understanding why you do this is something much later. Do not try to explain, it's a waste of time.

???There may be a game to use at this point, like Missile Command???

==== Move on to the buttons
Teach the most common paradigm (left-click ''go', right-click ''about').

If you are using Apple computers, well, do the Apple things.

==== Games
Now you can do the games, like,
