== Pinessar
Somewhere quiet
Try not to work when tired
Only work for 20--30mins
speak out loud
4/5 is fine for progress
repetition at staged distances
antipate responses in new situations
don't skip about
work daily
fill in gaps
No notes
(need words that reuse common glyphs)
Introduce, repeat, antucipate (how do you...)

almena method

Independent review - not bad, but american.

It is divided up into four lessons - one teaching keyboard, one where you practice the sentences, one, two and five-minute timed tests to build up your speed and the last one devoted to teaching how to eliminate errors (not included in the schools' model).

The secret of success with the Almena method is you really have to master the first lesson but, at any point during the tutorial, you can go to back to the main menu and the first lessons.
