[Note for teachers: no need to explain what memory is for, connections between memory and hard drive memory etc. Just say: the disk is where things are stored long term. The memory is where things that are running are stored. And that you can run out of memory, like you can run out of space on your table (the hard drive is like your cupboards). Do not talk abut RAM and ROM and busses and detailed things like that]
